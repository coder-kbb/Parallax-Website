                                            India is such a big country and is so popular with tourists that several of its main cities are among the most visited cities in the world, including Delhi. One of the reasons Delhi is popular is because it is close to a number of other top experiences in India, so it is a convenient base.
                                            <br> <br>

                                                The bustling city of Bangkok, Thailand, is one of the top tourist cities in the world, with nearly 26 million visitors a year. The city is usually the first stopping point for anyone touring through Thailand.

                                                Bangkok has an exciting mix of packed subways; huge skyscrapers; temples; historic architecture; lavish gardens; palaces like the Grand Palace; and almost nightly sporting events, like kickboxing, that draw thousands of fans.

                                                Spend time on the beaches near Bangkok for a mix of the city scene and a tropical ocean escape.

                                                    Hong Kong is one of the most famous cities in the world. It is a convenient holiday destination, and its shopping, especially for bargains, is unmatched.

                                                    Hong Kong is one of the most popular cities in the world, but it is also one of the most expensive places to travel if you plan to stay in the heart of the city. If you stay just beyond the main tourist areas in places like Jordan or Kowloon, you can find slightly less expensive accommodations.
                                                    <br> <br>
                                                    Some of the other reasons travelers flock to Hong Kong include an easy public transportation system, so there is no need to drive; massive theme parks; 24-hour dining; the world's largest skyscrapers; bargain shopping for high-end goods; and beaches and mountains that are quickly accessed just outside the city. You can even find beautiful hiking trails in Hong Kong.

                                                    Hong Kong also offers unusual finds that are just plain interesting, like a 24-karat solid gold toilet inside a Hong Kong jewelry company and a beautiful tunnel of pink flowers located inside the Un Chau Estate public housing complex.

                                                        The metropolis of Tokyo in Japan is one of the most exciting cities in the world, which is why millions of tourists go there every year. What makes Japan so popular is the whirlwind of eye-popping attractions, from ancient temples and Anime to the Tokyo Skytree broadcast tower.
                                                        <br> <br>
                                                        Tokyo has the world's most famous and biggest fish markets, and exquisite and artful sushi. Japanese culture is colorful and playful, and that is reflected in Tokyo's parks, museums, and malls. Tourists are attracted to the opportunity to learn more about traditional Japanese culture with experiences like trying on kimonos.

                                                        Japan's fantastic interconnected train system makes it easy to base yourself in Tokyo and make day trips to other places like Mount Fuji and Tokyo Disneyland.
